Certain school boards are alternating online days for older students in hotspots like Quebec. Once again, most universities are operating online.     The province of Newfoundland and Labrador's only university, Memorial University, is operating online for example, meaning they have no in person university classes in the province. Although most universities are technically doing this of their own accord, almost every university in Canada is public and funded/deeply connected to their provincial governments. So, while many universities did this of their own accord, I've put T2 because of their strong links to the government, and preemptive action negated a need to pass laws. In short, there is no reason for certain provinces to pass legislation, because these shut downs have already been done, likely in consultation with the provincial governments. The fact stands that there are entire provinces which do not have in person learning at the university level. Hence T2.     The entire decision making process is happening at a very decentralized level, happening in individual universities within distinct provinces. It is not generally closed however, since certain universities are doing in person classes. One example of this is St Xavier University in Nova Scotia (a smaller liberal arts university).

New Zealand,NZL,20200611,E1: Income support,2,0,"Background. As of June 4, New Zealand had 1,504 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, and 22 deaths. On March 25, 2020, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 restrictions after domestic transmission of the virus was found. The authorities declared a state of emergency and implemented strong containment measures including the closure of all non-essential businesses, cancellation of all events and gatherings, closure of schools, and cancellation of discretionary domestic air travel. This followed the closure of all borders and entry ports to non-residents on 19 March with returning citizens and residents required to self-isolate, and since 10 April to enter into two weeks of supervised quarantine. New Zealand’s economy was strongly affected by the decline in Chinese tourists in the first quarter (usually the high season due to Chinese New Year). In addition, merchandise exports to China declined in the first quarter of the year by 12 percent compared with the last quarter of 2019.    Reopening of the economy. The country moved to Alert Level 2 on May 14, lifting lock-down restrictions and maintaining social distancing in public and for private gatherings of more than 10 people, and 50 people for funerals. Schools reopened fully on 18 May, while bars reopened on May 21. Businesses re-opened with health and social distancing requirements, and domestic travel has been allowed. The borders remain closed to all but New Zealand residents, who must isolate in dedicated facilities for 14 days upon entry. The country had previously moved to Alert Level 3 from Alert Level 4 on April 28, allowing many businesses to re-open, though without physical contact to customers, and schools to re-open with limited capacity. People have been encouraged to continue to stay and work from home if possible. With almost no remaining active COVID-19 cases, cabinet is considering to move to Alert Level 1 on June 8, which would imply few remaining domestic restrictions but continued border closure.      Key Policy Responses as of June 4, 2020    FISCAL  With the FY2020-21 budget and previous fiscal packages, the government has announced fiscal measures amounting to a total of NZ$62.1 billion (21.3 percent of GDP) through FY2023-24, of which NZ$20.5 billion will be disbursed by end-June. The total amount includes the NZ$50 billion COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, a majority of which is yet to be allocated to specific spending programs. Already specified fiscal measures include: (i) healthcare-related spending to reinforce capacity (NZ$0.5 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (ii) a permanent increase in social spending to protect vulnerable people (total NZ$2.4 billion or 0.8 percent of GDP); (iii) a lump sum 12-week wage subsidy to support employers severely affected by the impact of COVID-19 (NZ$15.2 billion or 5.2 percent of GDP); (iv) income relief payment to support people who lost their jobs (NZ$3.1 billion or 1 percent of GDP); (v) a permanent change in business taxes to help cashflow (NZ$2.8 billion or 1.0 percent of GDP); (vi) infrastructure investment (NZ$3 billion or 1 percent of GDP); (vii) a temporary tax loss carry-back scheme (NZ$3.1 billion or 1.1 percent of GDP); and (viii) support for the aviation sector (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP). The government has also approved a NZ$0.9 billion debt funding agreement (convertible to equity) with Air New Zealand to ensure continued freight operations, domestic flights and limited international flights. The New Zealand government also provides loans of up to NZ$100,000 to small businesses that employ 50 or less employees. In addition, on March 28 the government announced temporary removal of tariffs on all medical and hygiene imports needed for the COVID-19 response.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618135750/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
New Zealand,NZL,20200611,E2: Debt/contract relief,1,,"MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept the official cash rate (OCR) unchanged at 0.25 percent on May 13 and signaled its intention to keep the OCR at this level for at least a year. The OCR was reduced by 75 basis points to 0.25 percent on March 17. The RBNZ has also announced a near doubling of the Large-Scale Asset Purchase program (LSAP) to purchase government bonds and Local Government Funding Agency (LGFA) in the secondary market up to $60 billion over the next 12 months. The RBNZ has doubled the overdraft on the crown settlement account to NZ$10 billion for April-June to meet the government's short-term cash needs.    The RBNZ has been providing liquidity in the FX swap market and re-established a temporary US dollar swap line (US$30 billion) with the U.S. Federal Reserve. The RBNZ has established a new Term Auction Facility (TAF), which allows banks access to collateralized loans of up to 12 months, and announced a corporate facility in which the RBNZ will offer up to NZ$500 million per week in open market operations with banks against corporate paper and asset-backed securities for 3 months. The RBNZ also introduced a Term Lending Facility (TLF), a longer-term funding scheme for banks at 0.25 percent for up to 3 years duration, available to use for six months from May 26. Access to the TLF is linked to each banks’ lending under the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme (see below) and will require approved eligible collateral. The RBNZ has reduced bank’s core funding ratio requirement to 50 percent from 75 percent to help banks make credit available.    To further support the stability of the financial system, the start date for a regulatory change requiring higher capital for banks has been postponed for 12 months, to July 2021 (to support up to about NZ$47 billion of additional lending), with other regulatory initiatives in the pipeline also put on hold for at least six months. The RNBZ has also agreed with the banks that during this period there will be no dividend payments on ordinary shares and redemption of non-CET1 capital instruments. The RBNZ has removed, effective as of May 1, mortgage loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions for the next 12 months.    The New Zealand government, the RBNZ, and the New Zealand Bankers Association have also announced a number of financial measures to support SMEs and homeowners. These include six-month principal and interest repayment deferrals to mortgage holders and SMEs affected by COVID-19 and a NZ$6.25 billion Business Finance Guarantee Scheme for SME loans, in which the government covers 80 percent of the credit risk.    Other related measures taken by the government that could contribute to financial stability include a six-month freeze on residential rent increases and increased protections for tenants for termination of tenancies. The government has also committed to a temporary law change to enable businesses to put existing debt into hibernation for six months.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618135750/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
