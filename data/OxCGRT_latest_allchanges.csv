Dominica,DMA,20210607,C8: International travel controls,2,,"As of 7 June 2021, authorities in Dominica ease certain COVID-19 travel requirements for fully vaccinated individuals (consider fully vaccinated individuals as those who received the final dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine more than two weeks before entering Dominica).  These individuals must follow the following guidelines to enter the country, regardless of their country of origin:  - Submit a health questionnaire online at least 24 hours before arrival in Dominica.  - Proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 24-72 hours before arrival.  - Upon arrival, they will undergo a health assessment and enter a government-operated quarantine facility or an approved property for at least 48 hours. On day two, they will take another COVID-19 test and remain in quarantine until obtaining the results; if negative, the quarantine may end; if positive, authorities will transport them to a COVID-19 isolation unit.    Persons who are not fully vaccinated must also take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 24-72 hours before departure for Dominica, submit the health questionnaire online at least 24 hours before arrival, and undergo a health assessment upon arrival. Additional requirements for unvaccinated travelers vary depending on their country of origin.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210614105901/https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/487686/dominica-authorities-ease-restrictions-for-travelers-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-as-of-june-7-update-18"

BoU has also worked with mobile money providers and commercial banks to ensure they reduce charges on mobile money transactions and other digital payment charges.    During its April 2020 MPC meeting, BoU reduced its Central Bank Rate (CBR) by 1 percentage point to 8 percent to counter the deteriorating economy, provide adequate access to credit and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets. Other concrete measures introduced include: (i) directing all Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) to defer the payments of dividends and bonuses for at least 90 days effective March 2020 to ensure adequate capital buffers are maintained; (ii) providing liquidity to commercial banks for a longer period through issuance of reverse Repurchase Agreements (REPOs) of up to 60 days at the CBR, with opportunity to roll over; (iii) purchasing Treasury Bonds held by Microfinance Deposit taking Institutions (MDIs) and Credit Institutions (CIs) in order to ease their liquidity distress; and (iv) granting exceptional permission to SFIs to restructure loans of corporate and individual customers that have been affected by the pandemic, on a case by case basis effective April 2020.    On April 17th, Bank of Uganda provided more guidelines to be followed by SFIs to safeguard financial sector stability. These include: (i) loan repayment holidays for a maximum of 12 months; (ii) granting credit reliefs only within the 12 month period with effect from April 01, 2020 –these should be in the best interest of customers and with full disclosure; (iii) the credit status at the time of granting a repayment holiday shall remain unchanged for the duration of the said repayment holiday; (iv) prepayment of arrears as a condition for restructuring a credit facility is suspended for 12 months with effect from April 01, 2020; (v) credit status at the time of granting a repayment holiday shall remain unchanged for the duration of the said repayment holiday; and (vi) borrowers are encouraged to request, and SFIs may offer, credit relief.

BoU has also worked with mobile money providers and commercial banks to ensure they reduce charges on mobile money transactions and other digital payment charges.

On June 8th, 2020, BoU further reduced its Central Bank Rate (CBR) by 1 percentage point to 7 percent to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the economy and ensure that financial institutions can further reduce their lending rates to steer lending. Average lending rates have fallen to 17.7 percent in April 2020 from 19.9 percent in January 2020, mainly because of the liquidity easing measures that have been instituted by BoU since the start of the pandemic.

The guidelines are published by the HelpAge NGO, rather than the Ugandan government itself. However, since they are referenced on the health ministry’s website as COVID-19 guidance and advice for older people, I assume these reflect also the guidance by the government. The pdfs provide the following guidelines:    •	general information about hygiene measures,   •	for care home staff to avoid going to work if they have symptoms,  •	to discourage visits where possible,   •	what to do if someone is infected,  •	for older people to take care of their general health,  •	recommendations for carers of an elderly person to stay at home as much as possible, to avoid visitors, to look after themselves in terms of diet  •	etc.    These nationwide guidelines don’t seem to map to a more stringent level 3 coding.
