On day two, they will take another COVID-19 test and remain in quarantine until obtaining the results; if negative, the quarantine may end; if positive, authorities will transport them to a COVID-19 isolation unit.    Persons who are not fully vaccinated must also take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 24-72 hours before departure for Dominica, submit the health questionnaire online at least 24 hours before arrival, and undergo a health assessment upon arrival.

All companies in Mauritius can apply for Wage Assistance subsidy to alleviate the employee cost for the month of March ranging from  15 days basic wage bill to MUR 12,500 per employee. Workers from the informal sector, i.e self-employed not registered with the revenue authority will get 50% of the prevailing minimum wage if they register with the revenue authority during the COVID19 lockdown.
