Notes that a suspected Covid case (a captain of a ship) had been tested for Covid-19 and the results had come back negative.  This suggests a policy of testing is in existence and is likely to have been in place prior to 28th March, although no policy on testing has been found, so code prior to this has been left as ""0"".  The tests were carried out in Australia.  It is assumed that reliance on other countries for testing will mean that testing is limited to symptomatic / suspected cases and is not available more widely.      Link:  http://archive.today/2021.01.26-174948/https://kiribatiupdates.com.ki/convid-19-results-proof-negative-in-tarawa/    Subsequent Facebook posts by the Australian High Commission for Kiribati notes the delivery of testing supplies and equipment (GeneXpert) on 1st May, 21st May, 25th August and 9th November 2020 which suggests that testing capacity within Kiribati progressively increases over the coming months.  A further post by the High Commission on 12th November comments on support provided for Kiribati to develop a PCR lab at Tungaru Central Hospital which will reduce its need for sending samples overseas for testing.  Taken as a whole, these comments suggest that whilst testing capacity increases, it has remained limited and is therefore unlikely to meet coding criteria for ""2"" or ""3"" throughout 2020.    Additional context: borders remained closed from March 2020 and Kiribati has continued to report no confirmed cases of Covid-19 throughout 2020.  "

New Zealand,NZL,20200529,20200607,C4: Restrictions on gatherings,2,1,"Friday 29 May 2020. Amendments to Alert Level 2 —  part of the gradual easing of restrictions that will happen as we move towards Alert Level 1.    ""Social gatherings can be held with up to 100 people    The limit for social gatherings will be lifted to 100 people. These include events at home and outside of home like religious services, parties, weddings, tangihanga and funerals. It is important everyone keeps playing it safe.    This means: While hospitality businesses continue to have the 100 person limit per defined space, group bookings of more than 10 people will be permitted, but the 3 S’s — seated, separated, single-server — still apply. A funeral or tangihanga will also have a 100 person limit, and organisers are no longer required to apply to the Ministry of Health to hold one. Social gatherings at a private dwelling will be able to have a maximum of 100 people. A business or responsible individual, in charge of a social gathering, must ensure records are kept for contact tracing purposes, except where every person in a gathering knows each other. This includes in your home, community hall, or other such space. Participating in community sport will also become easier, with greater numbers of people able to gather up to a limit of 100 people. Requirements for contact tracing still remain. Workers providing a service to a social gathering, such as waiters at a wedding, are not included in the 100 person limit.""    /web/20200602033409/https://covid19.govt.nz/latest-updates/alert-level-2-changes-confirmed-for-friday-29-may/"
